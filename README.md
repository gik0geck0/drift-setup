# Drift Alignment

## Front
Camber: -3 to -7, probably around -5; generally aims to flatten
Toe: 0 to 1/4" OUT, or 0.1 degrees toe OUT (front of wheels are further out from the car than the rear of the wheel); improves initial turn-in as well as following ackerman at angle
Caster: -5 to -7, more caster increases steering weight and also self-steer.
Ackerman: 0 to positive

## Rear
Camber: 0 to -0.5, usually 0; unlike road race cars, the rear of most drift cars remains fairly flat while in-drift, so optimal tire wear is reached with low amounts of rear camber.
Toe: 0 to 1/8" IN, or 0.1 degrees toe IN. (front of wheels are closer inside the car than the rear of the wheel); more toe-in translates to more grip and more tire-wear.
Caster: -5 to -7; not nearly as critical as the front

## General Susension Setup

### Ride Height
As a baseline, most suspension prefers the ride-height such that the lower control arm is flat/horizontal to the ground, which generally puts the dynamic range of toe and camber in a middle point to avoid the extremes. The most obvious range to avoid is swapping between toe in and toe out between compression and droop which would feel unstable or squirrelly.

### Spring Rate
Off-the-shelf rates (usually a balance between street and road-racing) are generally fine. Second step is usually softer spring rate for the rear. For example, [Feal Suspension](https://fealsuspensionstore.com/feal-coilovers-nissan-240sx-s13/) chooses 8k/5k for drifting a 240sx, where an [ISR Performance](https://www.isrperformance.com/isr-performance-hr-pro-series-coilovers-nissan-240sx-89-93-8k-6k/) comes in 8k/6k for a generic setup.

### Dampers
For street driving, you'll probably set to soft, like 1-4 clicks (0 = all the way left). Once you're at the track, a basic setup may be only changing the front to 20 clicks (stiffer), but leaving the rear soft.

// TODO: If you feel X you should adjust Y
// TODO: This section needs a lot of work and input from more experienced tuners, such as splitting compression and rebound for drifting, and is well beyond my personal experience.

## Tires

### Sizing
Wider = more life & more grip (note: this usually beats the added cost)
Bigger total diameter = more life & more grip
Thinner profile = snappier
More stretch = snappier

### Tire pressure
Never driven on these tires? Start at 30. Maintain a pressure as they get warm.

Lower pressure increases grip, but at the extremes also moves wear from the center to the edges. Conversely, higher pressure decreases grip, but at the extreme moves wear to the center of the tire.

### Treadwear and model
Unfortunately, Treadwear is not a reliable metric. Within a brand, it will tend to estimate the relative performance and life, but cross-brand especially for drifting is wildly misaligned. Treadwears are listed here just to ensure the specific model is understood, as some named models come in multiple TW options and come with grip & life trade-offs.

This list will grow out of date very quickly, but for first time readers, hope it helps:

#### Budget Lapping & Party Tires
Low grip, low budget, just get out and drive

- Ironman iMove Gen2
- Fullway HP108
- Westlake SA07
- Supermax UHP

#### Intermediate Lapping
More grip than the budget tires, roughly equal life

- Kenda KR20 (300TW)
- Zeknova Lanz8 (400TW) (bit more grip than Kenda, bit less life)
- Valino Ebisu Matsuri (360TW)
- Accelera 351 GD (less grip and less life than the above)

#### Grassroots Competition
Competition tires aren't expected to last very many laps, depending on power, wheel speed, and mechanical grip. These tend to be highly available but you'll burn through them.

- Kenda KR20a (200TW)
- Zeknova Supersport RS (300TW)
- Zeknova RS606 R4 (200TW)
- Valino 08C (300TW)

#### FD Competition (by grip, not legality)

- GT Radial Champiro SX2 [Prospec]
- GT Radial Cmapiro SX2 RS [Pro FD]
- Kenda KR20a MAX [Pro FD]
- Kumho Ecsta V730 [Pro FD] (and others such as PS91, but V730 is the grippy tire of choice)
- Nitto NT05 [Pro FD]
- Nitto NT555 G2 [Pro FD]
- Falken 615K (former)
- Valino 08R (200TW)
- Zeknova JR500 (240TW)
